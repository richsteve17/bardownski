# BARDOWNSKI OS

Give your balls a tug, tit-fucker. If you're looking for a generic React template, you're at the wrong barn.

BARDOWNSKI OS is a theatre of conflict, built for the "Rich Legacy" standard. It's where the "Gift of Gab" meets the "Grit of the Ring," designed by a degenerate with degrees in American Studies and Peace and Conflict Studies.

This is the manifest. This is the code. This is Bardownski.

## BARDOWNSKI OS: The Theatre of Conflict

"Wheel, Snipe, Celly - Manage the Rift."

Most hockey sims are just spreadsheets with ice textures. Bardownski is different. It's a Social Physics Engine. It treats locker room drama as the primary gameplay mechanic. You aren't just a coach; you're a mediator, an agent, and a heel.

## The Core Engine

### The War Room (Brain)
- Gemini-Powered Recruitment: Talk to prospects like Sully Sullivan. They have egos, they have "Receipts," and they will call you "Ten-Ply" if you lie to them.
- Dynamic Chirp Logic: Every message affects Trust and Heat. If you can't manage the ego, you can't manage the game.

### The Locker Room (Chemistry)
- Visualized Rifts: See the "jagged red lines" between players who hate each other.
- Social Physics: Conflict studies in action. High "Heat" leads to "Tilted" on-ice behavior, hero-ball, and "Friendly Fire" collisions.

### The Match Engine (Execution)
- Psychology-Based Simulation: Shifts aren't determined by OVR alone. They're determined by Swagger (Momentum).
- Bardownski Buffs: Score a pure snipe to refill the team's mental tank.

### The Scrap Engine (The Code)
- Dropping Gloves: A 1v1 rhythmic balance mini-game.
- Consequences: Win the fight to reset the momentum. Lose, and your "Anchor" starts seeing stars while the rookie gets rattled.

## Tech Stack (The Tape)
- Vite + React: For a mobile-first, high-speed HUD.
- Gemini 1.5 Flash: The "Brain" behind every ego and press conference.
- Tailwind CSS: Gritty, dark-mode "War Room" aesthetic.
- Lucide React: Precision iconography for the HUD.

## The Rich Legacy Rule

"Act like you've been there, or get off the pond."

This project is built on the Rich Steve philosophy: High stakes, deep analysis, and authentic conversation. We don't do "AI fluff" here. We don't do "safe" analogies. We do profound connection across psychology and leadership.
